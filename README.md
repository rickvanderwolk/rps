Play Rock-Paper-Scissors in your terminal. No setup needed—just one command and you're ready to play!

## ⚠️ Warning

Executing scripts directly from the internet, like with `bash <(curl ...)`, is generally a bad idea. It can expose your system to malicious code, security vulnerabilities, or unintended damage. Always review the code first to ensure it's safe and only run scripts from trusted sources.

## 🎮 How to play

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickvanderwolk/garage-8/refs/heads/main/rps/game.sh)
```
